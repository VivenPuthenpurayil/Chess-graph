# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    Our group will meet once a week in person or over zoom for 90 minutes. We set a time for Tuesday at 5pm but will work around it if needed.

2. **Assistance** 
    Each team member has already shared their phone numbers and email. We expect responses ASAP.

3. **Respect** 
    Members will be well respected and will make sure to speak out if anyone isnt allowed to speak their thoughts. 
    
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    We will organize a list of tasks we need during the weekly meetings and give each member their  task according to each members strengths. If there are any complications during a team members task, other members are allowed to help them out to allow for the highest quality work 

5. **Time Commitment** 
Each team member is required at a minimum to spend their 90 minutes during thee weekly team meeting. Aside from that, each team members time working on the project will vary depending on the amount of time their weekly task requires to finish


6. **Conflict Resolution** 
Disagreements between members will be solved by having other members intervene or speaking to our mentor on the topic. If it is a solvable issue such as a member constantly being late or not doing their work, we will talk it over with the group and have a conversation and assess why they arent contributing and fix it accordingly.
